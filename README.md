# Login By Key Stroke Dynamic using Flutter and Firebase

A term Project of ITCS461_Computer And Communication Security

# Project Description 
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the traditional username and password authentication mechanism by incorporating keystroke dynamics.

This approach will help to mitigate unauthorized access and improve overall user authentication.
